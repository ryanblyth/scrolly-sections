# Apps Specs

**Apps = consumers; packages = producers**

This directory contains specifications for the application-level consumers of the scrolly-sections library.

## App Specifications

- [**Kitchen Sink**](kitchen-sink.md) — Comprehensive "all sections together" page
- [**Singles**](singles.md) — Single-section pages app (one page per section, with intro & outro)

## Purpose

Apps demonstrate how to consume the scrolly-sections library in real-world scenarios:

- **Kitchen Sink**: Shows composition and integration of multiple sections
- **Singles**: Shows focused development and testing of individual sections

Each app spec defines behavior, performance budgets, and acceptance criteria for its specific use case.
