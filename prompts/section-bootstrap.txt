You are implementing a new section inside the scrolly-sections workspace.

Use this spec template:
- docs/specs/sections/SECTION_SPEC_TEMPLATE.md  (read carefully)
- For Trail Scrub: docs/specs/sections/trail-scrub.md

Goals:
- Scaffold or update the package under packages/sections/<name>
- Implement the Section API (createSection â†’ mount/unmount/isMounted)
- Ensure Vite builds ESM + IIFE and emits CSS asset
- Add a minimal demo hook in apps/kitchen-sink

Constraints:
- TypeScript + SCSS per spec (namespaced classes)
- Keep entry bundle light; heavy libs lazy by the orchestrator
- Idempotent mount; clear errors on missing target

Output:
- File tree of created/updated files
- Commands you ran (install, build, dev) and summaries of results
- Which Acceptance Criteria from the spec are satisfied
